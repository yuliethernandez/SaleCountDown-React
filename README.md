# SaleCountDown-React
Instructions
Open the src/components directory in the saved project. This directory includes:

An App.css file that contains the styling for the application.
An App.jsx file is the highest parent component of the app.
A NavigationBar.jsx file that has the code for the navigation bar component.
A HeroSection.jsx file that contains the hero sections of the page.
A Logo.jsx file that holds the SVG logo for the app.
A SalesBanner.jsx file, where you will create the sales banner.
Your task is to add code to the SalesBanner.jsx component. The features of the SalesBanner component should be:

A short attention-grabbing message (such as, "Blow out Sale", "Spring Cleaning Sale", "BOGO 50% Off", etc.)
A count-down timer counting down how much time is left until the sale ends.
Here is an example of how the sales banner should look if the sale started at midnight the day before and will last five days.

Requirements
You cannot use any packages that have a timer or countdown functionality.

The banner includes an appropriate message.
The banner should match the design of the rest of the page, but it does not have to be identical to the banner shown in the screenshot above.
The SalesBanner component must have a functional countdown timer that lasts a total of 5 days starting on the date you create the component.
The SalesBanner component must use hooks to manage state and side effects.
You must clean up your effects.
The component must have the functionality to hide the banner when the countdown ends.
Do not make changes to any other components in the starter code.
